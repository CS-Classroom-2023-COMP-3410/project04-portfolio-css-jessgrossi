            <p>Hi, I'm Jessica Grossi, a creative enthusiast and productivity lover. I've been bullet journaling for 4 years and find it to be the perfect way to combine art with organization. Additionally, for me journalling is a way to calm down and relax.</p>
            <p>I stumbled upon bullet journaling early during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020, as a way to ignore the state of the world and entertain myself as I was no longer able to see friends. What started as a productivity tool quickly became a creative outlet and a source of joy.</p>
            <p>This website is my way of inspiring others to organize their lives while embracing their creativity. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned journaler, there's something here for everyone.</p>
            <p>When I'm not journaling, you'll find me experimenting with digital art, reading fantasy novels, or exploring local coffee shops.</p>
            <p>I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to share your thoughts, questions, or journal designs with me at <a href="mailto:jmgrossi11@gmail.com">jmgrossi11@gmail.com</a></p>
