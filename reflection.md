Getting the general styling to work on a web browser on my computer for me was pretty easy. This was becuase sense I have turned in my basic html webpage I released that because of how I wanted my webpage(s) to look chat gpt used div style elements throughout. So I moved all of those div style elements to a style.css file and naming the titles to fit comments of areas to make it easier to go back through and add these class names to html files. After our css class I understand that css can be three forms: external css files (liked used here), internal css by using <div style> tags and inline css using style attribute.
